<h1> DubDal photography </h1>

<br>
<img src="img/image2.png" width="427" height="426"> <div class="desc"><br>This was a photo I last posted</div>
<br>

<p>The first photo I ever did was done on a iphone I did crop it so it doesn't look werid. The last photo I took it was on the canon rebel t6.</p>

<h1>What camera should you use?</h1>
<p1>If you wanna get a cheap but workable camera use your phone camera. Differet phones different quality. But if you got money to spend try getting the canon rebel t6 for $500. There are different models, but the t6 is great for beginners!</p1>

<br>
<h1>Why I did photography</h1>
<p1>I did photography because I aways took a liking to photos, so being able to take photos would be so cool!.</p1>
<p1>I first started off with my old ZTE android which wasnt the best but it was all i had at the time. then i got the ihpone XR which made me happy still not the best but it was really good for a phone and that is when i knew i wanted to be a photographer.</p1>
<p1>So i went to my mom and said hey mom can i get the canon rebel t6 for my brithday. (my brithday was 6 months away so it was a long wait.) But on my bday i got it and i loved it.</p1>

<br>
<h1>Did i work for anyone?</h1>
<p1>When i only had my iphone a friend of mine who is a photographer, I ask him hey can i join your photography work. He said yeah so then i was apart of sure_shots_16! when i got my camera (canon rebel t6) about 2 month i quit to make my own business. There i made my new business DubDal photography.</p1>

<h1>Do you ever wanna be a photographer?</h1>
<p1>If you wanna be a photographer you can there is nothing stoping you from being a photographer. Stuff pull out your phone and start with that, If you love doing photography maybe try getting a camera. Like i said if your new try getting the canon rebel t6. That camera is easy to use. Some people don't know how to use it just mess with it until you find out how to use it.<p1>

<br>
<h1>What is it like being a photographer</h1>
<p1>Many poeple just  do photography as a hobby but, there are poeple who do it as a job. Like news reporters and wedding photographers.</p1>\
<p1>I do photography like a hobby and a job sometimes i get paid for some stuff and sometimes i take photos because it is fun.</p1>
