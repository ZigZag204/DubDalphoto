<img src="img/image2.png" width="427" height="426"> <div class="desc"><br>This was a photo I last posted</div>
<br>

<p>The first photo I ever did was done on a iphone I did crop it so it doesn't look werid. The last photo I took it was on the canon rebel t6.</p>

<h1>What camera should you use?</h1>
<p1>If you wanna get a cheap but workable camera use your phone camera. Differet phones different quality. But if you got money to spend try getting the canon rebel t6 for $500. There are different models, but the t6 is great for beginners!</p1>

<br>
<h1>Why I did photography</h1>
<p1>I did photography because I aways took a liking to photos, so being able to take photos would be so cool!.</p1>
<p1>I first started off with my old ZTE anroid which wasnt the best but it was all i had at the time. then i got the ihpone XR which made me happy still not the best but it was really good for a phon and that is when i knew i wanted to be a photographer.</p1>
<p1>So i went to my mom and said hey mom can i get the canon rebel t6 for my brithday. (my brithday was 6 months away so it was a long wait. But on my bday i got it and i loved it.</p1>

<br>
<h1>Did i work for anyone?</h1>
<p1>When i only had my iphone a friend of mine who is a photographer, I ask him hey can i join your photography work. He said yeah so then i was apart of sure_shots_16! when i got my camera (canon rebel t6) about 2 month i quit to make my own business. There i made my new business DubDal photography.</p1>
